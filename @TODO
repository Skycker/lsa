- Decrease connectivity between keeper/DB-backend modules and search machine
- Fix mechanist of plugging DB and keeper modules. Fixed names for built-in ones + custom classes as params
- Divide SearchMachine into SearchMachine and IndexerMachine
- Performance improvement
    - Check matrix handling
    - may be implement parallel matrix manipulations (multiplication, transposition)
    - the more iterators, the more pink pony
- Features
    - ability to provide full sql query for DB backend + simplified mode (just table name and id field)
    - ability to provide custom stop words collections
    - more stemmers from nltk library
    - normalizers from nltk library
    - improve search algorithm (calculate distances to part of space, not to any document)
    - html cleaner
    - other doc types support
    - limit search results
